# Pure CSS Smiley Emoji
A single, delightful smiley emoji crafted entirely with pure HTML and CSS—no images, no JavaScript, just clean code! This project showcases how a simple yet expressive emoji can be created using only the power of CSS styling.

# Why This Smiley?

100% Code-Based – No external assets, lightweight, and fast-loading.

Fully Customizable – Easily change colors, size, and expressions with just a few CSS tweaks.

Scalable & Crisp – Looks sharp at any size, thanks to CSS vector styling.

Interactive Fun – Hover effects or animations can be added for extra charm!

Perfect for learning CSS techniques, adding a playful touch to your projects, or just experimenting with creative front-end design.

# How It Works

This smiley is built using simple HTML elements (like <div>) styled with CSS to create:

A round face (using border-radius)

Expressive eyes (with box-shadow or pseudo-elements)

A friendly smile (crafted with CSS transforms or border tricks)
